They look beautiful online, seem to offer a way to escape the mortgage trap and present an opportunity to downsize your possessions, but how simple is real life in a tiny house?

Fay (not her real name) and her partner live in a tiny house that they built themselves in the Perth metropolitan area.

She told Jessica Strutt on [ABC Radio Perth](https://www.abc.net.au/perth/) that their tiny house is comfortable but that "the first thing you notice is that it gets messy really quickly".

"The same surface has multiple uses so if you have something on that surface and you want to use it for something else you have to clear it up.

"If you are planning to do something you think, 'I will have to do this first before I can do that' — it's a Tetris game.

"The biggest attraction of the tiny house for Fay, is in her mid-30s, was home ownership without a heavy mortgage.

"The main reason why I went to tiny was the financial side of things," she said.

> "There is satisfaction in having built this ourselves, and actually living this ideal … of not having to get a loan … to have a roof over our heads."

Fay's tiny home is slightly more spacious than most, thanks to her partner.

"My partner is over two metres tall so I get to enjoy the extra height that we had to design into the tiny house so that he could be happy living in it," she said.

"There is a certain lightness about it I suppose, because we do have fewer things."
