The United States Census Bureau classifies Kensington as a “hard-to-count” community, so for our latest issue, we tackled a series of stories that explore the importance of residents getting counted in the 2020 Census, and what an accurate (or inaccurate) population count means for the neighborhood.

We asked various community organizations, including[ New Kensington CDC](https://kensingtonvoice.com/en/nkcdc-2020-census/), [Kensington Library](https://kensingtonvoice.com/en/kensington-library-2020-census/), [Congreso de Latinos Unidos](https://kensingtonvoice.com/en/congreso-de-latinos-unidos-2020-census/),[ Esperanza Health Center](https://kensingtonvoice.com/en/esperanza-health-center-2020-census/), and[ Providence Center](https://kensingtonvoice.com/en/providence-center-2020-census/), to write about why the Census matters to them. We also explored what the City of Philadelphia and neighborhood organizations are doing to [improve Census participation](https://kensingtonvoice.com/en/kensington-at-risk-census-undercount/)in populations at risk of an undercount, including[ Hispanics and Latinxs](https://kensingtonvoice.com/en/how-city-kensington-community-fix-hispanic-undercount/), [youth](https://kensingtonvoice.com/en/heres-how-phillys-tackling-youth-undercounts-ahead-of-the-2020-census/), and[ people experiencing homelessness](https://kensingtonvoice.com/en/how-will-the-2020-census-count-people-experiencing-homelessness/).
