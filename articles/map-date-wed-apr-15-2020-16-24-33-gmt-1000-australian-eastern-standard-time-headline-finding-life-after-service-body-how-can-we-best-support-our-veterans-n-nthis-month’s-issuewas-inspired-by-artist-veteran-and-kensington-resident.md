## How can we best support our veterans?

This month’s issuewas inspired by artist, veteran, and Kensington resident[John Zerbe](https://www.instagram.com/jczerbe89/), who is running art workshops for veterans throughout the neighborhood. While working alongside other veterans, he saw that many of them wanted to share their stories and connect with others. More importantly, he suggested that Kensington Voice report on how exactly to access the VA benefits that veterans are entitled to. We decided to start asking around and discovered that other veterans were wondering the same thing.

We talked with some of the organizations in the neighborhood that are helping veterans access these resources, like[Impact Services](http://www.impactservices.org/)and the[Veteran Multi-service Center (VMC)](https://vmcenter.org/). We also stopped by organizations in Kensington that have stepped in to help veterans when they weren’t able to access their VA benefits, like[The Last Stop](https://www.facebook.com/laststopclub/)and[Rock Ministries](https://www.therockphilly.org/), too. Throughout this issue, we met many men and women bubbling with talent, life stories, and advice for other veterans looking to receive their VA benefits.

So to kick off a new year of Kensington Voice in 2020, we present you*Finding Life After Service*, a series of articles and media that aim to remind all of us that Veterans Day is not the only day we should be discussing how to best support our country’s veterans.
